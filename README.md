# Organization Chart

Created by Brandon Griffin for Dr. Cage as part of the MCPS 2025 Summer Internship for College Students program.

## Setup 

Install the following requirements:
- Node.js (LTS v22)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Svelte extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) (for development)

Open a terminal and install the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Now you can start the Vite development server with the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

When you need to generate static files for GitHub pages, use the following command:
```
npm run build
```

## Debugging

Start the development server in a terminal if you haven't already with `npm run dev`, then run the debug configuration called Debug in Chrome.
